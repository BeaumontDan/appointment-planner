## Description

This is a React training/learning project, set by [Codecademy][codecademy], untilising React to create a Appointment Planner Application.

## Codecademy Objective


##### Overview

Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you'll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

##### Project Goals

"In this project, you will use functional React components to create an app that manages contacts and appointments. The app consists of two pages: one to view and add contacts and one to view and add appointments."

"You will work with stateful and stateless functional React components using hooks. The requirements section will walk through implementing the app from the topmost component down. If you would like to implement it in a different order, feel free to do what is comfortable for you."
